The registry (dev/engine/work-path-registry.md) is the routing baseline for the
v0.0.1 skill architecture. Each of the 16 work paths is registered as a fenced
```yaml block. These tests (T2.1-T2.7) validate the registry's own structure and
internal consistency only -- they do not exercise any engine logic.
